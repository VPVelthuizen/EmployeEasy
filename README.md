## Description
This employee tracker will introduce easy, intuitive commands to help employees track their employee data!

## Installation
In order to use EmployeEasy, the following applications are needed: psql, node, and the npm packages dotenv, inquirer, and pg.

## Usage
In order to use the application, run node index.js in the command line, this will initialize the process! It will then ask you what you would like to do. Selecting a "view" option will present a table with the information requested. Asking to add or update information will prompt you to present more information, which you simply enter. The data will be added and summarized for you.

Here is a video demonstrating the functionality!
